### What's This?
This is my project to solve
https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1
in Python

### Context
This is my first Python project (kindly supported by Copilot, ChatGPT and some very nice friends).
As a stone-old Java developer my angle is to
- 🌱 Find out how to do things in Python (including typical project structure)
- 🧩 Solve mysteries the likes of "Why the heck doesn't it find that other module?" 😆
- 🎄 Having some fun w/ AOC ([yeah u know me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idx3GSL2KWs))

🙋‍♂️ If you have feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear from you.
